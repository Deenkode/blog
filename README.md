## Setup and Development

If you're looking to contribute to the development of the blog platform itself (fixing bugs, adding features to the theme configuration, etc.), follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Install Hugo:** Make sure you have Hugo installed on your system. You can find detailed installation instructions on the [official Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
    * **Verify Installation:** Open your terminal and run `hugo version` to confirm it's installed correctly.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Deenkode/community-blog.git](https://github.com/Deenkode/community-blog.git)
    cd community-blog
    ```

2.  **Initialize and Update Submodules (for the Stack Theme):**
    The Stack theme is included as a Git submodule. This command pulls in the theme's code.
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3.  **Run the local development server:**
    ```bash
    hugo server -D
    ```
    The `-D` flag ensures that draft posts are also rendered locally.

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1313/` (or the address shown in your terminal) to see the blog running locally. Any changes you make to the content or configuration will automatically refresh the page.

### Adding New Content

To create a new post:
```bash
hugo new posts/<your-post-title-here>.md
